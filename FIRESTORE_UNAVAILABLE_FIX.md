# Firestore "Unavailable" Error - Troubleshooting Guide

## Error Message
```
[firestore/unavailable] The service is currently unavailable. This is a most likely a transient condition and may be corrected by retrying with a backoff.
```

## What This Error Means
This error occurs when your app cannot connect to Firestore. Even with retry logic (5 retries with exponential backoff), the connection is failing.

## Most Common Causes & Solutions

### üî¥ CAUSE 1: Firestore Security Rules (80% of cases)

Your Firestore security rules are likely blocking access. 

**How to Fix:**

1. Open Firebase Console: https://console.firebase.google.com/
2. Select project: `hybridrpg-53f62`
3. Go to **Firestore Database** ‚Üí **Rules** tab
4. Replace your current rules with:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    
    // Users collection
    match /users/{userId} {
      // Allow authenticated users to read/write their own document
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
      
      // Companion sub-collection
      match /companion/{document=**} {
        allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
      }
    }
    
    // User progress collection
    match /userProgress/{userId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
    
    // Workout sessions
    match /workoutSessions/{sessionId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
      allow create: if request.auth != null;
    }
    
    // Programs (read-only for all authenticated users)
    match /programs/{programId} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
}
```

5. Click **Publish**
6. Rebuild your app

### üî¥ CAUSE 2: Network Issues (Emulator vs Device)

**If using Android Emulator:**
- Firestore connects to real Firebase servers, not localhost
- Emulator needs internet access
- Check your computer's internet connection

**Solution:**
```powershell
# Restart Metro bundler
npx expo start --clear

# Rebuild app
npx expo run:android --device
```

---

### üî¥ CAUSE 3: Authentication Token Expired

**Solution:**
1. Log out of the app completely
2. Force close the app
3. Reopen and log back in
4. Try again

---

### üî¥ CAUSE 4: Firebase Configuration Mismatch

**Verify Configuration:**

1. Check `android/app/google-services.json`:
   ```powershell
   Get-Content android\app\google-services.json | Select-String "project_id"
   ```
   Should show: `"project_id": "hybridrpg-53f62"`

2. Check `android/app/build.gradle`:
   ```powershell
   Get-Content android\app\build.gradle | Select-String "applicationId"
   ```
   Should show: `applicationId 'com.fitnessrpg.app'`

3. Verify these match in Firebase Console ‚Üí Project Settings ‚Üí Your apps

---

## Testing & Diagnostics

### Run Firestore Diagnostic Test

Add this to your `HomeScreen.js` or any screen to test connectivity:

```javascript
import { printDiagnosticReport } from '../utils/firestoreDiagnostic';

// Add this in a useEffect or button press
useEffect(() => {
  printDiagnosticReport();
}, []);
```

This will print a detailed report in your console showing:
- ‚úÖ Authentication status
- ‚úÖ Read permissions
- ‚úÖ Write permissions  
- ‚ùå Any errors encountered

---

## Step-by-Step Fix Procedure

### Step 1: Update Security Rules
1. Go to Firebase Console
2. Update Firestore Rules (see above)
3. Publish rules

### Step 2: Verify Firebase Config
```powershell
# Check project ID
Get-Content android\app\google-services.json | Select-String "project_id"

# Should show: hybridrpg-53f62
```

### Step 3: Clean Build
```powershell
# Clear Metro cache
npx expo start --clear

# Clean Android build
cd android
.\gradlew clean
cd ..

# Rebuild
npx expo run:android --device
```

### Step 4: Test App
1. Open app on device/emulator
2. Log in with existing account
3. Check Metro logs for diagnostic messages
4. Look for:
   - ‚úÖ "User authenticated"
   - ‚úÖ "Can read own user document"
   - ‚úÖ "Can write to own user document"

---

## Updates Made to Your Code

### ‚úÖ Enhanced Error Handling
- Better error messages in `HomeScreen.js`
- Specific error codes displayed
- Fallback values to prevent UI crashes

### ‚úÖ Increased Retry Resilience  
- Retry attempts increased from 3 ‚Üí 5
- Exponential backoff: 1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, 16s
- Located in: `src/utils/firestoreRetry.js`

### ‚úÖ New Diagnostic Tool
- Created: `src/utils/firestoreDiagnostic.js`
- Tests authentication, read, and write permissions
- Provides actionable recommendations

## What to Check in Metro Logs

After rebuilding, look for these messages:

**Good signs:**
```
‚úÖ Firestore offline persistence enabled
‚úÖ User authenticated: <uid>
‚úÖ Can read own user document
‚úÖ Can write to own user document
üîç Active program IDs from Firestore: [...]
üìä Active programs data: [...]
```

**Bad signs:**
```
‚ùå User not authenticated
‚ùå Cannot read user document: firestore/permission-denied
‚ùå Cannot write user document: firestore/unavailable
üî• FIRESTORE UNAVAILABLE - V√©rifiez: ...
```

---

## Emergency Fallback Rules (Testing Only)

**‚ö†Ô∏è ONLY FOR TESTING - NOT FOR PRODUCTION**

If you need to quickly test if it's a rules issue:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
}
```

This allows all authenticated users to read/write everything. Use ONLY for testing!

---

## Still Not Working?

If after all these steps it still doesn't work:

1. **Check Firebase Status**: https://status.firebase.google.com/
2. **Verify your Firebase project is active** (not disabled)
3. **Check Firebase Billing** (Firestore requires Blaze plan for production)
4. **Try a different network** (corporate/school networks may block Firebase)
5. **Test on a real device** (not just emulator)

---

## Quick Reference Commands

```powershell
# Clear and restart Metro
npx expo start --clear

# Rebuild Android
npx expo run:android --device

# Check Firebase project ID
Get-Content android\app\google-services.json | Select-String "project_id"

# View Android logs
adb logcat *:S ReactNative:V ReactNativeJS:V
```

---

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Update Firestore Security Rules in Firebase Console
2. ‚úÖ Rebuild the app
3. ‚úÖ Test with the diagnostic tool
4. ‚úÖ Monitor Metro logs for errors
5. ‚úÖ Report back with any new error messages
